We've completed our first ever Hack Day at G Media.
I think we all agreed it was good fun, and great to take time out to try something different, and entirely up to each of us what we tackled.
Here's some pics of the results - please excuse my disappointing phone camera.

## Gav's new Airwave UI elements (in progress!!)

### Luke's Facebook inspired instant messaging client

Steve's developer bar - you can just about see it at at the bottom, with an error log expanded. And above, a crazy network traffic analyser thing he installed. It was pretty impressive to watch.
