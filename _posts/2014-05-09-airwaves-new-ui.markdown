![](http://mm.gmstatic.net/1/896712.jpg)**For a hack day last year, I chose to
build a new Airwave UI, mostly for form elements and tables.**

It turns out one day isn't long enough to complete a project like that, but I
made a good start on it.

It was then left on the shelf while we concentrated on more pressing projects.

Then, earlier this year, with some of those important projects out of the way,
we decided our Advertising product needed an overhaul.

Clients were very keen for some new features, and a much easier way to find
and manage their inventory.

When we started building this new app, one thing became clear; the current UI
was holding us back.

We wanted to do smarter things, reducing the steps to create something,
removing the barriers and make things much simpler.

So I got the new UI off the shelf, cleaned it up and introduced it to the new
Ads product.

With a growing team, there's a need to have re-usable building blocks which
make it quick to build new things, but also retain consistency across the
product.

Our old UI, which is still in use across much of Airwave, is based on a table
layout, which isn't appropriate these days, and there's no real consistency to
the way it is used across the system. The only thing you can especially rely
on seeing is blue cells down the left and grey cells down the right.

With the new UI, the background colouring is out. In steps a cleaner,
'chunkier' interface.

The code to make this happen is much simpler and easier to create something
really quickly.

I'd like to share a few examples of before and after, so you can see how much
this is an improvement.

**BEFORE, editing streams for an on demand file**

AFTER, the same section with much cleaner separation, and the new save button
positioning**

**BEFORE, editing an on demand item**

**AFTER, the same section, with new date range control, image selection and preview, divider and title. Also notice the consistent small grey text underneath each form field, known as microcopy. In the old UI there was no consistent format or position for this kind of text.**

**The brand new 'editable table' control. On the left you see the default state with 4 items and a row to add a new one. On the right, we're editing the Insurance item.**

**The brand new 'daypart selector' we built for advertising campaigns, so they can be only shown at certain times of the day on specific days. You can create any configuration of highlighted cells and it's really simple to drop in to any page.**

The new Airwave UI will continue to be phased in across the service over the
coming weeks.

We're continuing to develop new controls to use, and welcome your feedback.
